# Exploring MIMIC 2 with Jupyter

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/melbourne-cdth/explore_mimic2/HEAD/?urlpath=lab)

These notebooks provide you the opportunity to gain familiarity with medical data by some exploration of a small collection of de-identified data collected during the course of hospitalizations.

There are currently three notebooks. A fourth notebook exploring text data will be available shortly.

- [visualize_case_timeline.ipynb](visualize_case_timeline.ipynb): This notebook provides a timeline of when data were generated during the patients' hospitalizations and by whom were they generated. You can select switch between which patient you wish to visualize.

- [explore_mimic_data.ipynb](explore_mimic_data.ipynb): This notebook provies an opportunity for more detailed exploration of data values generated for individual patients. You can select which patient you want to explore, which table of data to examine, and which column from that table you want to plot.

- [multisubject_exploration.ipynb](multisubject_exploration.ipynb): This notebook is similar to `explore_mimic_data.ipynb` but allows for selecting multiple subjects at the same time and comparing the distributions of values for the selected variable across all the selected patients.

## Some General Notes

Suggestions for how to explore each table are provided with a `tab widget`.
